      <p>Discover how a mushroom dataset can guide you in distinguishing between poisonous and edible mushrooms. This data, conveniently available through UCI, is also hosted on my GitHub for easy access.</p>

      <p>This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a decision tree model in a practical context. After a couple of years spent studying statistics and enrolling in various courses, I was eager to apply what I've learned, no matter how seemingly insignificant. You can find both the dataset and the scripts used on my GitHub.</p>

      <p>Several models can be utilized to predict outcomes, but I desired a model that offers traceable steps and could serve as a guide. Unlike many models that output a result without revealing the journey, decision trees differ â€“ you can visually comprehend the steps the model undertook to arrive at its conclusion.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-title">How I Created this Model</h3>

      <p>I first encountered this dataset in my Applied Machine Learning Course at the University of Michigan. The dataset was utilized as a teaching tool for identifying the Gini importance of each feature. Additionally, we were tasked to construct a decision tree using another unrelated dataset. Upon discerning the significance of each feature, I was intrigued to see if I could turn this into a comprehensible decision tree that could possibly classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.</p>

      <p>To achieve this, I used Jupyter notebooks and created a local directory for all the data and other elements I would be working on. The steps I followed are presented here in a more organized sequence than the actual process - initially, I attempted to input the data into the classifier without performing data cleanup. While this didn't affect the outcomes, it resulted in an unreadable dataset/tree. The bulk of my project time was dedicated to gaining a deeper understanding of decision trees, what a random forest is, what Gini importance implies, and reading documentation on visualizing the tree. I used Graphviz to manually populate the tree and relabel the fields or features of the model.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-title">The Outcome</h3>

      <p>My objective was to create a useful tool for mushroom foragers, despite the inherent risk in such activity. The result of this project is presented below. Using this model, a user can examine a mushroom and answer a question. If the answer to that question is true, you move left on the diagram; if false, you move to the right. A coral-colored node (leaf) signifies that it is highly likely the mushroom is poisonous, while a blue one indicates it's edible. Despite the model's accuracy score, it isn't flawless. Always be aware of the risks associated with this activity, and consult an expert.</p>
