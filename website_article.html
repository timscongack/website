        Why would I create a website to show all my projects? The other substitutes (like Github) didn't seem suitable; they either didn't have the appropriate layout and other services like Webflow, Wix and Squarespace (website creation tools) required a paid subscription and wouldn't give me the same experience as building my own website.
        </p>
        
        <p class="project_body">
        I also wanted to be able to go back to each project and re-trace my steps for each project and reimplement certain pieces of it. For my coursework and projects and I want a permanent home/area to store them. Given the time I spend weekly on this work too I thought it was important to show alongside my resume where my time was being spent.

        How I Made the Website
        </h3>      
        
        <p class="project_body">
        This was my first website project created using CSS, HTML, and hosted it on Netilfy, using Google domains. I got started using the tutorial below you’ll notice that a lot of the design is based on this tutorial. The tutorial also shows you how to deploy a website using Netilfy. If you are using this as a how-to article just a heads up you’ll have to spend time applying your Google domain to Netilfy.

        <p class="project_body">
        Important note; if you are a beginner know that creating a Django site isn’t too bad using tutorials. But if you’re going this route know that deploying is difficult.
        
        </p>
        <p class="project_body">
        I also tried creating my resume site using word document to HTML converters online to get the outline of my resume, after hours of trying to incorporate the HTML/CSS I ended up re-writing most of the HTML/CSS for my resume site - so don’t do this.                
        </p>

        <p class="project_body">
        After following this tutorial though I didn’t really have a good understanding of CSS/HTML, and didn’t have all the pages - so I started creating these pages with the code I had and learned how to made cards, write CSS from scratch. It wasn’t until I created my projects page (the page with the cards) that I really started to learn how HTML and CSS interact. It was really challenging to get the design I wanted. I also learned that I’d need to learn Javascipt or a Python framework in order to expand the functionality of my site. I had completed a Python website with Django framework previously but ran into problems deploying my site.            
        </p>

        <h3 class="stats-heading text-center my-1">
        What I Learned
        </h3>
        <p class="project_body">
        First, the syntax of HTML and CSS - I didn’t know the basics of HTML/CSS. I simply followed the tutorial blindly, then dug deeper when needed. I learned how to create references, ‘classes’ with HTML and CSS, how to set variables, set parameters in CSS. I learned a lot of smaller lessons about the interaction with elements in CSS. It wasn’t until I created my projects page, and finalize my resume page that I understood the basics of CSS/HTML - having said this though, blindly following the tutorial was an important step as I related concepts from the tutorial to other things I was trying to do.                    
        </p>        

        <p class="project_body">
        The tutorial outlined how to create a responsive website; the key here was using media queries and testing it out both on small desktop windows and mobile devices once my site was launched. I also asked for people’s feedback on the website once I launched - it was amazing how much good feedback you can get. Within a few hours, I re-wrote the media queries and had a more improved version of my site up and running.                     
        </p>

        <p class="project_body">
        The most important component of all of this learning was using VS Code to create the site. Downloading the add-in on auto-completion and live server really allowed experimentation and me to write the code quickly; I could easily change code and see the outcome instantly. This instant feedback allowed me to detect typos/errors and prompted me to google specific questions. Also, another key step was using the inspector, after opening the page in live-server I right-clicked and hit inspect - this allowed me to see how the code interacted with the layouts.                     
        </p>

        <p class="project_body">
        HTML/CSS is limiting, building a website that incorporates Javascript or Python allows more complicated functionality. Depending on what future functionality I want on this site - or to increase the productivity of posting (instead of editing HTML) I might do another project on templating posts and another on incorporating my existing site into Python/Django. For now, I’ll stick with this website template so I can work on more data-focused projects and post - thanks for reading.
